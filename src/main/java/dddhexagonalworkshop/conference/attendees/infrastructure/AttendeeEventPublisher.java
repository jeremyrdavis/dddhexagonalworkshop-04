/**
 * "The application is blissfully ignorant of the nature of the input device. When the application has something to send out, it sends it out through a port to an adapter, which creates the appropriate signals needed by the receiving technology (human or automated). The application has a semantically sound interaction with the adapters on all sides of it, without actually knowing the nature of the things on the other side of the adapters."
 * Alistair Cockburn, Hexagonal Architecture, 2005.
 *
 * This class is an adapter that publishes events to a message broker.  It is using MicroProfile Reactive Messaging to send events to a topic named "attendees".
